## User testing

## Addressing CI feedback

### Code Coverage

- We have just 2 domain classes, that both have simple methods that are easy to test. Since these
  two classes are relatively short, there is simply not that much to test. Hence our code coverage
  is quite low at just 9%.
- We could increase our code coverage by adding automated ui testing, however, given how much effort
  this would take for not much return; We instead decided against this. 
- Hence our code coverage stands at just 9%.

### Code Quality

- We decided to ignore distracting issues from the code quality reports (These included things such
  as line index and private method documentation). Instead we addressed other issues, mostly
  relating to adding documentation.
- We were able to increase code quality from a B to A rating.
